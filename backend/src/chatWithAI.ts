 * @file chatWithAI.ts

 * It retrieves relevant knowledge from Pinecone and generates a response
 * based on the user's message and the retrieved context.
 *
 * The prompt has been refined to instruct the AI to provide definitive, data-backed responses.
 * Every statement must be supported by citations referencing the provided context, and any prediction
 * (such as future FED interest rate movements) must be based on historical data-backed reasoning.
 *
 * Additionally, if the provided context is limited, you must incorporate your verified internal economic
 * knowledge to explain key economic events driving the trends. Your answer MUST be definitive with no uncertainty.

 * economic events to deliver a conclusive and definitive response.
 *
 * Implements RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) by querying Pinecone for relevant
 * knowledge based on the user's message. This ensures the AI always has sufficient information to provide
 * accurate, definite, and fully cited answers.
 *
 * @param history - The conversation history (an array of message objects).
 * @param message - The new user message.
 * @param systemInstruction - (Optional) A system instruction to guide the AI.
 * @returns A promise resolving with the AI's response text.
